/**
 * The Confiant RTB API provides event metrics to help monitor the service availability and performance,
 * most importantly for new creatives. As bids get submitted to the RTB API, a first timestamp is immediately stored
 * to represent the time of submission (submitted event). New creatives are queued and fetched asynchronously
 * by the Confiant application (fetched event). Creatives are scanned to assess creative attributes and potential issues
 * (scanned event). Finally, results are synchronized back to the Redis instance (synchronized event).
 * All DateTime strings are represented in ISO 8601 format.
